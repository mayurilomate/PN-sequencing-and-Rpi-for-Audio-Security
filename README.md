# Audio Security using P-N Sequence & Raspberry Pi

## Abstract:
In response to the contemporary imperative for secure handling of audio data, this project focuses on enhancing audio data communication security. By leveraging P-N sequences and MATLAB in conjunction with Raspberry Pi, the aim is to reinforce security measures, addressing the pressing need for robust protection of sensitive information in today's digital landscape.

## Brief Overview:
The project initiates with MATLAB recording an audio file in .wav format, converting it into a binary stream, and then applying XOR operations with a P-N sequence. The modified data is transformed into a .txt file for transmission between two Raspberry Pi microcontrollers, employing Secure Communication (SC) protocols. Upon reception by the second Raspberry Pi, the text file is extracted, and the XOR operation is reversed only if the P-N sequence matches. The decrypted binary data is then processed to retrieve the original signal, ensuring secure transmission and restoration of the audio data.

## Purpose and Objective:
The primary purpose is to establish a robust security framework for file reception, aiming to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted audio data from potential interception by unauthorized parties. The main objective is to develop an efficient audio file data communication security system using P-N sequences and Raspberry Pi, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information during the transfer process.

## Methodology Used:
1. **Broad Spectrum Signal:** Ensures efficient transmission of audio data, enhancing reliability and quality.
2. **P-N Sequencing:** Integral for encryption and decryption, establishing a secure key mechanism.
3. **Secure Communication (SC) Protocols:** Crucial for confidentiality and integrity during transmission, establishing a secure and encrypted communication channel.

## Summary and Key Findings:
1. **Decryption Based on P-N Sequence Matching:** Ensures audio decryption only when P-N sequences match, preventing unauthorized access.
2. **Installation of MATLAB Libraries on Raspberry Pi:** Essential for smooth execution, facilitating interoperability between MATLAB and Raspberry Pi.
3. **Key Finding:** Emphasizes the importance of utilizing public and private keys for secure transmission, ensuring protection from unauthorized access.

This project offers a comprehensive solution for secure audio data communication, leveraging P-N sequences and Raspberry Pi to enhance security measures and protect sensitive information in digital communication channels.
